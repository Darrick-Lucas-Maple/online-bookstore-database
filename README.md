# online-bookstore-database
A group final project from Intro Database System course in which we had to implement a database structure in mySQL and to interact with it through a Java program.

# Abstract
Our database is created for our online bookstore to store
the following:
- Book
- Publisher
- Author
- Stock
- Warehouse
- Order
- Shopping Cart
- Customer

With these records stored we can see who the publisher and author of
the book is, check the number of books currently in the warehouse, and allow
customers to order books. Given the structure of our database we believe that
this can also be used in similar scenarios where an online bookstore database is
needed.

# Tools Used
- E-R Diagram 
- Schema 
- Java
- Netbeans
- JDBC
